## Hand-on Lab environment
### Pre-requisite of attending this hand-on labs   

1. Workstation OS: Windows 10, Mac or Linux  
2. Browser : Firefox or Chrome  
3. Network : Internet Connection  
4. Workstation privilege : Change browser setting for proxy (provided in Lab)  

### Lab environment description 

1. One RedHat OpenShift Cluster is provisioned for the lab exercises. Each student will be assigned with one OpenShift project which will contain all the Robot Shop microservices and he/she will perform the execises within his/her project.  
2. OpenShift project naming convention : ns-{1-25}  each student will have its own project respectively. e.g. ns-6  
3. Turbonomic platform is deployed under turbonomic project on the same OCP cluster.  
4. An Instana backend server is deployed within an virtual server.
5. Access link and account name with password will be provided.    

## Labs for Instana and Turbonomic
### Lab 1 : Deploy and start Robot Shop microservice  
1. Login to  Openshift Web console and input the IBMID provided in the Lab  
Open browser with URL : https://console-openshift-console.itzroks-060000f2ee-hx8q5z-4b4a324f027aea19c5cbc0c3275c4656-0000.hkg02.containers.appdomain.cloud/ (Your IBMID registered in IBM Cloud https://cloud.ibm.com e.g temp2222temp@gmail.com in this lab example)  
![Alt text](./pic/ibmlogin.png?raw=true) 

2. Dasboard of RedHat OpenShift will be shown as below (Be reminded you are now logged in as OCP cluster admin and you get privilege to perform cluster level destructive actions. Just focus on your own OCP project please)  
![Alt text](./pic/ocpproject.png?raw=true) 

2. Create an new OpenShift project to host your microservice applications. Click "Home"->"Project" and then click "Create Project" button and name the project ns-{1-20}. The project number will be assigned during the workshop. e.g. ns-6
![Alt text](./pic/createproject1.png?raw=true)  
![Alt text](./pic/createproject2.png?raw=true)  


3. Start the OpenShift web terminal by click the >_ button on the top right concer of the OCP Web GUI. It may take one or several minutes for the terminal to show up.   
![Alt text](./pic/webterminal.png?raw=true)  

4. Switch to OpenShift project to contain all microservices under Robot Shop for each student. Execute the command 'oc project ns{1-20}'. Ensure you switch to an correct project and don't fix up with other students. e.g.    
```bash
oc project ns-6
oc project
```
![Alt text](./pic/createproject.png?raw=true)  

5. Execute the following steps to deploy all microservices under Robot Shop.    
```bash
oc project ns-6
cd robot-shop
pwd
./install.sh 
```
![Alt text](./pic/createappservice.png?raw=true)  

6. Ensure all of them are in Running status (it may takes around 5 minutes to download the docker images from container registry - located in gitlab and docker.io. Take an 5 minute coffee break) 
```bash
oc get pod
watch 'oc get pod'   
```
![Alt text](./pic/allpodsrunning.png?raw=true)  
Also, you is able to check the deployment status of those services via OCP Web GUI
![Alt text](./pic/deployment.png?raw=true) 

### Lab 2 : Access to Instana server and create application perspective  

1. Ensure to you have configured the browser proxy settings according to the parameters provided by the Lab. Otherwise, you are not able to access to the Instana backend server via browser (since the server is located on privated on-premise environment which require proxy server to access)  
2. Login to Instana Web GUI https://instana.ibmdemo.local using admin@instana.local account with its password.         
![Alt text](./pic/instanalogin.png?raw=true) 

3. Create Application Perspective by clicking "Application" icon on left toolbar         
![Alt text](./pic/applications.png?raw=true) 

4. Click "+ Add" button located at right bottem concer and then click "+ New Application Perspective". It will prompt an dialog "New Application Perspective"   
![Alt text](./pic/newapplicationperspective.png?raw=true) 
5. Click "Switch to Advanced Mode" located right top concer.             
![Alt text](./pic/switch.png?raw=true) 

6. Provide the following information for the application perspective for your OpenShift project created in previous lab execrise. For example, ns-6 
```bash
a. Application Perspective Name : ns-{1-25}
e.g. ns-6
b. Define the Application Perspective using one or more tags. Click "Add filter" and choose Kubernetes, then Namespace and then input the OCP project name.
e.g. Kubernetes->Namespace->ns-6
c. Store Calls of Downstream Services : "All downstream services"
d. Select the Default Dashboard View : "All Calls"
```
e.g.
![Alt text](./pic/applicationsettings.png?raw=true)   
7. Click "Create" button and you will be return to the "Application" page of Instana. You should find the application perspective you have just created.
